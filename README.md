# inventory
Created for a university, the app allows book inventory to be managed by scanning the bar code, book data (title, etc) is obtained from the Google Books API

The SQL file to create the database is not included, if you would like it, please just send an email to danny@dewdevelopment.com and I'll send it to you.

Installation is quite easy:
1) Create the database and tables needed (again, you can get the SQL from me)
2) Modify the config.php file to contain your details
3) Then upload all files to your server webroot.

If you have any questions feel free to send me an email.
